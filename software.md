All of my projects are hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com) and are listed in chronological order below.

## [SurveyMan-related software](http://surveyman.org)
Surveys can be thought of as programs. Not only do they have control flow, but they also have bugs and composable abstractions. We developed a language that expressed these abstractions and was designed to prevent some bugs and make other bugs easier to diagnose. 

# [SurveyMan programming language](http://github.com/SurveyMan/SurveyMan)
The abstract SurveyMan programming language is a tabular language with random choice.
