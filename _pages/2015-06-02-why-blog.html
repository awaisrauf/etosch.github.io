<p>Before the internet, academics and intellectuals shared their musings and worked out problems via letter writing. Read any math "paper" before 1920 and you will notice the casual tone and seeming lack of formality in the notation. These letters were not public, but they were not exactly private either. I see today's blogs as an extension of that letter-writing tradition.</p>
<p>Now, not everyone will agree with me. For some, blogging is more formal -- it functions as a compendium of advice and pithy explanation, or it is an avenue to push work that may not have a home elsewhere. For others, it is more informal. This blog is somewhere between open letters to no one and what might otherwise end up lost in a research notebook or in casual conversation in front of a whiteboard. </p>
<p>To make blogging truly worth it, it helps to have comments. I've noticed that some graduate students turn off comments in their blogs and prefer to hold the conversation over email. I welcome comments over email, but would prefer if they happened in the open, where others can participate, if they wish. </p>
<p>So, please enjoy, and be in touch.</p>
<p>Emma</p>
