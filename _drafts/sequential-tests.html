<p>The gap between statistics and computer science is much larger than it has to be. I suspect the cause of this gap is strongly cultural. From what I understand, there was some resistance to applied statistics at the top statistics departments in the 90s. The focus on computation and algorithms in CS is distinctly applied -- an emphasis on *how* to solve a problem has a distinctly applied smell to it. Of course, today statisticians use an assortment of more or less well designed programming languages to perform analysis. I remember using SPSS (or was it SAS?) in my freshman-year stats class. I don't know if things have changed since then, but from what I remember, most of the effort was in data entry and interpreting the results. Actually running a program (whether a regression or ANOVA) was just a line of code. Of course, these things are just a line of code in R, but at least with R, you can interact with the data. Granted, it's possible I just didn't know how to interact with/manipulate data in SPSS then, so it's possible I'm maligning these tools unfairly. </p>
<p>In any case, most of the programming languages for statistics I'm aware of are pretty weak on the CS side of things. These programming languages might strive to look like math, but issues with binding variables (Python, though I'm told this problem is fixed in 3.0) in what ought to be closures (I'm still not clear on the closure story in R) and a complete absence of types (save Julia. love Julia) makes the flow from CS to stats seem pretty sad. </p>
<p>Conversely, it sometimes feels like the simplicity of Bayes' Rule has made all these newfangled data scientists throw design to the wind. Somewhere in the history of CS and stats there was a divergence; for example, I associate MDPs with CS more than stats, even though the problem is clearly a statistical one. </p>
<p>Maybe it's the desire for stats to be more like probability theory? Statistics is clearly empirical in nature. It's well-suited to have close ties with CS. There certainly are close ties, but I've found it curious that those ties aren't closer. The story, the set of techniques, and the theory behind statistical methods employed by CS -- these things aren't unified in any way. Maybe that's why data science has really caught hold?</p>
<p>Enough of </p>
