<p>Searching through the entire space of hypotheses is hard, but if we can visualize the space, we can let researchers figure out the balance between exploration and exploitation.</p>
<p>Difference between this and AutoTask -- AutoTask only shows humans their small task. It doesn't actually leverage the part of search and computation humans are "good at" -- reasoning about complex relationships. A lot of computation goes into evaluating the potential payoff for nodes in a search tree and deciding whether or not to expand it. If we could use humans to make this decision, we could perform more efficient evaluations.</p>
