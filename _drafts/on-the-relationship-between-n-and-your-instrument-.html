<p>One of the issues we would like to be able to address eventuallyÂ in SurveyMan is the the problem of automatically determining the sample size for a survey. Last year, <a href="http://emeryblogger.com/">Emery</a> and I discussed the idea of running a survey until we converged upon a distribution. We eventually moved away from this problem, since it was not the primary concern SurveyMan was designed to address. Our focus has been on bugs in the instrument. The idea was that if there aren't enough sample points to make inferences, our tool will simply report that. We found that when it came to the kinds of surveys we were running, we did not have sufficient data points to return a meaningful confidence interval for the point estimate. Since we wanted to show that the tool was an appropriate substitute for the domain-specific tools we'd encountered (e.g. <a href="http://spellout.net/ibexfarm/">Ibex Farm</a>), we did not focus our attention on power analysis.</p>
<p>Now I'm starting to think about how some of Emery's static analysis ideas and how they actually relate back to this problem of determining the correct sample $$n$ and the related problem of power analysis.</p>
<p>Consider entropy in the survey. We had discussed how one might go about finding bounds on the size of the space of answers and its relationship with the sample obtained during a pilot study. If the survey consists of 5 yes/no questions, there are 32 unique complete survey answers*</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* If you allow breakoff and have full randomization, then for number of questions in your survey $$n$$ and number of answer options $$m$$, you actually have $$ \sum_{i=1}^n m^i \cdot i! $$</p>
