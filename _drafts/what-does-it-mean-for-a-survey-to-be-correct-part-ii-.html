<p>SurveyMan was designed to be used in an iterative process of identifying survey bugs and refining survey "programs." Since there is considerable variability in both survey instruments and survey populations, I don't think it's appropriate to provide a cookbook for debugging surveys. Instead, we should approach the problem from (at least) two different perspectives: the formal approach, which I began in Part I, and a more empirical approach, which looks more like data analysis. </p>
<p>The formal approach tackles survey correctness from a programming languages an more broadly computer science perspective. It focuses on properties of the survey instrument. This is an important perspective to consider because the survey instrument is what researchers have the most control over. </p>
<p>The more empirical approach I will describe in this post discusses properties of the data and how the survey design should change in response to the data. </p>
