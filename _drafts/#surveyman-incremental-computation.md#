start with something about running into matt hammer at pldi 2016

building the survey in the UI can be modeled using incremetnal computation
we had previously been working under the model that the user specifies the complete survey in, e.g., a csv, and then uses the SurveyMan static analyzer to ensure correctness. however, when we allow users to build up a survey using a library such as the java api or the python library, we are in a different position: users may pass through non-well-formed states between well-formed states.
