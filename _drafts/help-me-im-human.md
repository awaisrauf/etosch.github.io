title: Help me, I'm human
---

It's Sunday morning and I'm on a Southwest flight to Florida for the PLDI PC meeting. Since this week will be spent travelling, and there's no shortage of things to do, I'm trying to get some coding done in-flight. I used to really enjoy working in-flight: there are few distractions and nothing else to do. You can either sleep or focus. When I was in college, all of my flights were international, so I spent the time on huge jets getting caught up on reading and drafting outlines of papers.

Now things are different. First of all, this is a domestic flight, so the plane is much smaller. Planes now offer wifi, so even people like me who want to work on a Sunday morning have access to the tools that enhance their productivity. This plan does not have outlets, but many often do.

However, these amenities are basically an illusion. Despite the fact that I *should* be able to get work done, I cannot, due to cost-cutting measures taken by airlines to increase revenue.

About a year and a half ago, there were two major incidents aboard airlines that caused them to make an emergency landing. Both involved passengers getting into fistfights over space on the plane. I'm reminded of this now as I attempt to work. I volunteered to take a middle seat, since at 5'3", I am fairly short. Indeed, even with my backpack tucked under the seat in front of me, I can full extend my legs.

The real issue is that I am currently struggling to use my laptop. I use a 13" Macbook Air, so it's reasonably sized. The only reason I don't use anything smaller is because I find less screen space noticibly curtains my productivity. My elbows are tucked in close to my sides, and the range of motion I can exercise is alarmingly small. From the angle of the tray table, I'm getting a little tingling sensation in my fingers while I type.

Even before the person in front of me reclined their seat, I didn't have much room to type. I don't believe that passengers should be prevented from reclining -- the angle of these seats can be quite hard on one's back. However, the current situation is also untenable for anyone trying to do work. Currently, the seat in front of me is only reclined a little. I know from prior experience that if they attempt to recline further, not only will I not be able to use my computer at all, since it will be forced off the tray table into my abdomen, but there will also be a moment where I will have to act quickly to close the computer before the screen gets wedged between the seat in front of me and the tray table. Fortunately Airs are durable and alumnium is flexible -- a lower quality machine would have snapped. Would Southwest compensate me for my damaged machine? Uncertain.

Anyway, all this got me thinking about how we're coming to a head with how we treat work. Although we have more devices and seemingly more places where we can be productive, those spaces are increasingly uncomfortable [and sometimes even] hostile to us. Of course we shouldn't be working all the time, but really, what choice do we have? There's an arms race of productivity. When we live in a world of contract workers, underemployment, and "right to work" laws, we must embrace those productive moments because real life threatens our ability to stay focused on the job at all times. And yet, we see companies make short-sighted cost-saving decisions that are inconsistent with this model all of the time.

Any with that, I'm off to steal some time in the bathroom, where I stand a better chance of getting things done.
