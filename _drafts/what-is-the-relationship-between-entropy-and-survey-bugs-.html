<p>We've made the argument that more entropy in a survey translates to more easily identifying bugs in a survey. But what exactly is the relationship between entropy and debugging?</p>
<p>Before we collect any data for a survey, we run a static analyzer on it. One of the pieces of data that our static analyzer returns is the maximum number of bits necessary to describe the survey's distribution of responses. How should users interpret this number? For what values is ento</p>
