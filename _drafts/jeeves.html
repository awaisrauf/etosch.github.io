<p>Jean Yang visited UMass during my last week at Google, so I didn't have the chance to see her talk. However, I did just finish reading her paper on Jeeves. I had skimmed it previously, but this time I took a closer look. I thought there might be some interesting applications for SurveyMan that could use her approach to protecting sensitive data.</p>
<p>Jeeves is a DSL for describing how sensitive data may be viewed. This DSL separates core implementation of an application from the privacy logic. </p>
