### SurveyMan: Programming and Debugging Surveys

I am working with [Emery Berger](http://www.cs.umass.edu/~emery) on a programming language and runtime system to design, debug, and deploy scientific surveys on the web. We collaborated with [Joe Pater](http://blogs.umass.edu/pater) from [Linguistics](http://www.umass.edu/linguist); this work became my [Synthesis Project](https://www.cs.umass.edu/grads/synthesis-and-ms-project), which earned an [Outstanding Synthesis Project](https://www.cs.umass.edu/oaa2015). We first presented [SurveyMan](http://surveyman.org) at the [2014 Off the Beaten Track workshop](http://popl-obt-2014.cs.brown.edu). This work won first place at the [PLDI Student Research Competition](https://www.cs.umass.edu/news/latest-news/pldi-2014-awards-emery-berger-and-plasma-students). We later presented the full paper at [OOPSLA 2014](http://2014.splashcon.org/program/program-splash2014), where it won a [best paper award](http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=133191&org=NSF) (3 awarded in total).

### COSMOS: A New Experimental Criterion for Genetic Programming

Typical Genetic Programming experiments focus on the convergence of the best candidate program in a population. Practicioners often use both parametric and non-parametric hypothesis tests to compare metrics such as computational effort or mean-best-fitness. [Lee Spector](http://faculty.hampshire.edu/lspector/) and I found that the number of independent runs needed to ensure reliability of such tests varied greatly across problems. We proposed a new criterion for determining the number of independent runs required to make inferences about a set of Genetic Programming techniques. Presented at the First Workshop for Understanding Problems, GECCO 2012.
