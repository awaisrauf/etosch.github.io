<p>Over at <a href="http://ezyang.tumblr.com/" title="ezyang's research log">ezyang's research log</a>, Edward reports on SPJ's question of <a href="http://ezyang.tumblr.com/post/102771565197/type-class-lookup-with-tries">whether tries would improve typeclass lookup</a>. There are no comments yet, but it would be nice to see some discussion!</p>
