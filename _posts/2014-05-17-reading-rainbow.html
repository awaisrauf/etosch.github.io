<p>It's only a few short weeks until <a href="http://conferences.inf.ed.ac.uk/pldi2014/">PLDI 2014</a>. Oh, the tedious and expensive travel! Just kidding (well, not really -- it will involve quite a few trains and many, many dollars). </p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~tachard/">Alex Passos</a>'s yearly <a href="http://atpassos.me/">NIPS reading list</a>, I'm going throw together one of my own. Rather than listing abstracts, I'm going to just post an ordered list of the papers I'm going to read and post on individual papers as I see fit.</p>
<h3>Tier 1 : Authors I know</h3>
<p>Unless the conference is massively multi-tracked, I find having to ask if someone I've actually met and spoken with IRL if they have a paper at the conference a bit tactless. This isn't to say I haven't done it, or that I've done so in a completely shameless way. I do however recognize that refraining from such behavior is A Good Thing.</p>
<ol>

</ol>
<h3>Tier 2 : Authors my advisor knows</h3>
<p>It's a reasonable assumption that my advisor probably knows at least one author on each paper, so we can also call this category "Authors whom I might reasonably expect to be introduced to by My Advisor." These papers include authors whose work I've read before and whose names I know from discussions with my advisor. Reading these papers will help prevent the awkward standing-there thing that happens when someone who is much more comfortable than you are (er, than I am) is deep in a conversation and you (I) have nothing to add. It'll also provide a hook that's socially more acceptable to whatever random thought happens to be passing through your (my) head. Genius, this plan is!</p>

<h3>Tier 3 : The Competition</h3>
<p>The Student Research Competition, that is. Some of those presenting at SRC are also presenting work at the main event. Since we'll presumably have some forced socialization, it's probably a good call to get an idea of what some of their other work is about.</p>

<li><b>Globally Precise-restartable Execution of Parallel Programs </b><br />
Gagan Gupta, University of Wisconsin-Madison; Srinath Sridharan, University of Wisconsin-Madison; Gurindar S. Sohi, University of Wisconsin-Madison.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are 13 participants in the SRC total. Five are presenting at the conference proper (One is on a paper in another tier).</p>
<h3>Tier 4 : Pure Interest</h3>
<p>No motivation, except that the papers look interesting.</p>

<h4>Why is pure interest ranked last?</h4>
<p>People say that a talk should be an advertisement for the paper. If I don't get through the papers in tier 4 before PLDI, I'll at least know which talks I want to go to and perhaps prune that list accordingly. Since a conference is actually a social event, it seems like a better use of time to target papers that I would expect to come up in conversation. I haven't tried this tactic before, so we'll see how things go!</p>
<p>Finally, I'd like to thank the NSF, the ACM, and President Obama for help on my upcoming travel.</p>
