<p>About a month ago, <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/csutton/">Charles Sutton</a> stopped by UMass to give a talk called "<a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mlfriend/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.StatisticalAnalysisOfComputerProgram">Statistical Analysis Of Computer Programs</a>." Here are my lightly-edited, cleaned-up (ish) notes on the talk (this approach inspired by <a href="http://ezyang.tumblr.com/">ezyang</a>'s amazing note-taking abilities):</p>
<!--summary-->
<p>conceit -- text as language<br />
(bad metaphor)<br />
computer program = precise set of instructions<br />
people -- more aspects (social interactions)<br />
language a good metaphor as a mean of human communication</p>
<p>when writing code, others may want to use later<br />
next person might be you!<br />
research:<br />
-- lots of open source code online<br />
-- lots of implicit knowledge in how to write software -- libraries api, avoid bugs<br />
-- easy to read, easy to maintain<br />
take implicit knowledge and make explicit<br />
writing code in a new library, look at what people did in the past<br />
suggest patterns<br />
key insight: means of communication<br />
regularities of natural language (NL) may be found in programming languages (PL)<br />
no new machine learning<br />
apply existing techniques to statistical NLP, new patterns<br />
coding conventions<br />
-- names, formatting<br />
summarization<br />
-- get a compressed representation of long verbose source files<br />
mining idioms<br />
-- small syntactics patterns in code<br />
describe how we use them</p>
<p>NL coding conventions<br />
local-&gt;global movement of abstraction<br />
what kinds of coding conventions?<br />
examples:<br />
junit example<br />
create input stream in java<br />
create an identifier<br />
name of input stream<br />
maybe know the type of name someone would use who contributed to the junit project<br />
formatting--e.g. braces<br />
coding convention is a syntactic constraint beyond that imposed by the languages grammar<br />
programmers themselves decide to impose on top of what the compiler requires them to do<br />
developers care a lot<br />
style checkers style guide</p>
<p>“small amount” of research in software engineering<br />
how they use these in software engineering...</p>
<p>go through conventions, find out what's important -- big commercial (microsoft) projects</p>
<p>threads different aspects of code committed</p>
<p>38 percent related to conventions rather than functionality<br />
(why i hate code review!)</p>
<p>why not just run a formatter over the code?<br />
corner cases -- it doesn't handle for you<br />
renaming variables to be more consistent → (<a href="http://www.jsnice.org/">jsnice</a>)<br />
review time -- can talk more about the functionality<br />
where do conventions come from?<br />
- implicit from code base<br />
one programmer starts, others pick it up<br />
emergent quality<br />
mores, rather than laws<br />
large number of software constraints, well modeled with statistical machine learning<br />
even with a lot of programming experiences, won't know about how things are named<br />
coding convention inference problem --&gt; why not use machine translation to take my conventions and change them to your conventions?</p>
<p>eclipse plugin called devstyle</p>
<p>click on your identifier, will give you a list of other names<br />
renaming suggestions<br />
how should class objects be named<br />
some disagreement with conventions<br />
we can suggest a name<br />
go through a region and rank names<br />
block of code someone wants to add to the project</p>
<p>how large of a corpus would you need?</p>
<p>what kind of technology do you use inside the scoring function?<br />
n-gram language model</p>
<p>smoothing, taking into account the constraints of the compiler/language conventions<br />
constraint is library of changes<br />
only renaming, not generating syntactically correct (would not be syntactically correct)</p>
<p>pull together all uses of the identifier</p>
<p>look at the set of all other names that have been used anywhere in previous or succeeding context<br />
ask ngram language model of joint prob. of entire file -- sounds really expensive<br />
-- actually using any ngram centered about the thing we want to rename</p>
<p><a href="http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/~dietz/">laura</a>: coreference analysis on the code<br />
-- knowing that i and i are the same gives you a nonlinear language mode<br />
-- can you get something more robust<br />
-- tapping the compiler for name resolution<br />
-- how do you corporate into the model (only incorporate into the suggestions -- done post hoc)</p>
<p>score by ngram model, threshold so user doesn't see terrible suggestions<br />
side effect of architecture:<br />
don't want names to be very common<br />
system does not choose really common names<br />
sympathetic uniqueness principle<br />
have variable program entity, give unusual name<br />
have a very domain specific thing, such as smoothing, choose an appropriate name, considered appropriate big statistical properties</p>
<p>in training set, if we have an id that occurs infrequently, give ? for unknown (deals with tails of the distribution)<br />
suggestion process for alternatives, use known token<br />
whatever context, use rare word, don't suggest change</p>
<p>what happens if you have a common word, but there should be an unusual -- don't know if there is an answer to this common/question</p>
<p>like adding a new table in a conditional random field (CRP)</p>
<p>formatting conventions<br />
encoding spacing decisions as tokens (indexed by location, foo)</p>
<p>use same framework or suggestions on this basis</p>
<p>does this thing work?<br />
evaluation methodology<br />
automatic evaluation:<br />
-- doesn't say what this is (is it the generative thing, idempotency -- thats how you would explain)<br />
-- should really being doing a case study no user study or human evaluation or whatever</p>
<p>don't want low precision win this tool because people won’t use it<br />
95% accuracy -- basically, what google does<br />
can do this for other types of identifiers, but its harder<br />
sympathetic uniqueness -- do we rename everything as i?<br />
x axis is similar, how often do we make revisions<br />
y axis -- element of surprise -- things that were rare, what percentage did we incorrectly try to say were something else<br />
set threshold high, no suggestions, no new names<br />
set threshold low, rename everything</p>
<p>methods, variables, and types are very different<br />
variables and types back off<br />
methods are much more surprising all of the time</p>
<p>naturalize tools</p>
<p>final thing -- test on github, submit patches<br />
look at top suggestions on top 5 suggestions<br />
submitted 18 patches<br />
14 accepted<br />
do programmers really care about this kind of name<br />
suggest that their exceptions be renamed from e to t?<br />
t was okay<br />
throwable (t) to e<br />
people accept t<br />
evidence that programmers think about and care about<br />
paper on arxiv -- fowkes, ranca, allamanis, lapata, sutton</p>
<p>question: exists bad users?<br />
- AI complete question</p>
<p>question: hard metrics for successful renaming -- most people like it better?<br />
- programmers are picky<br />
- does it actually make programs easier to maintain</p>
<p>question: fancier language model better?<br />
- yes, think so<br />
- types are names recovering -- very conventional (very GP)<br />
- java -- names are 1:1 correspondence to class</p>
<p>question: run on dynamic languages?<br />
-- no results<br />
-- corpus of java, c, python<br />
don't know if its run on python -- i don't think it would work as well on python because it is not as redundant as java</p>
<p>new topic:<br />
autofolding to summarize code</p>
<p>summarize, compress out java boilerplate<br />
use code folding (which obviously uses the fact that we know blocks are denoted by braces)</p>
<p>is the summary just folding?</p>
<p>difference audiences<br />
task based vs non task based<br />
experience versus novice<br />
expert in project<br />
first look problem -- opening single file first time, get overview</p>
<p>TASSAL -- tree based autofolding software summarization algorithm<br />
start with file, parse, say we want to compress certain types -- block statements, comments</p>
<p>foldable tree -- subset of AST that contains nodes we could consider following</p>
<p>file → bag of words -- split identifiers by camel case<br />
some of these are going to be generic java stuff<br />
some are concepts used throughout the project</p>
<p>topic models -- find characterizing words for files and packages; tried method as leaves, but this was too sparse</p>
<p>for each node, pick a mixing distribution</p>
<p>single topic per file -- packages or other levels of abstraction &lt;-- wonder if you could use this for refactoring</p>
<p>-- fit the model<br />
this will give us for each token in the source file an indicator variable whether this thing is generated from java, package, file (how characteristic)</p>
<p>think of optimization problem<br />
vector u binary vector<br />
each element indicates whether node is folded<br />
-- okay, so topic models for summarization, dug<br />
look at all tokens assigned to file via generative process<br />
empirical distribution of nodes included in the summary</p>
<p>constraints within budget for length of the summary</p>
<p>tree consistency<br />
-- if a node is included in the summary, must include parents</p>
<p>optimise via greedy algorithm</p>
<p>question: what about naming or other conventions that are drawn from different natural language distributions?<br />
-- clusters of developers that following different conventions -- cluster developers together with both formatting naming -- models don&#039;t work as well</p>
<p>question: what if i have multiple devs collaborating ON THE SAME FILE?<br />
-- topic per continent<br />
-- run topic per content<br />
-- where does z come from?</p>
<p>taking topic models and applying to name? not done yet</p>
<p>look at example topics<br />
example columns are topics<br />
three background topics (e.g. get string baclue name type object i)<br />
projects: spring, bigbluebutton<br />
files: datasourceutils, qualsp</p>
<p>to evaluate:<br />
create gold standard<br />
folded files manually to measure precision and recall<br />
compare with<br />
javadocs -- always include, add random<br />
shallowest to deep<br />
expand nodes in order of length<br />
heuristic, but that’s all eclipse is doing -- comparing with state of the art</p>
<p>second:<br />
show summaries to developers<br />
6 developers, avg. 4 years industrial experience<br />
-- rate conciseness and usefulness<br />
these are more concise and useful<br />
automatic summaries from TASSAL were better than any of the other baselines</p>
<p>third thing:<br />
mining idioms from code using existing NLP tools</p>
<p>what are code idioms?</p>
<p>example: reading into a buffer, iterating over an array<br />
-- are these all things that are encapsulated by other abstractions?<br />
opening resources/context -- common pattern<br />
need meta variables </p>
<p>code idiom is a syntactic code fragment that recurs frequently across software projects and has a single semantic purposes</p>
<p>-- wondering if you could learn to match ASTs from one language to another (from one that has these higher level abstractions to one that doesn&#039;t)</p>
<p>idiom-related tools -- intellij and eclipse</p>
<p>no way of identifying which idioms are useful (presumably to add them to the IDEs -- how do you find new ones)</p>
<p>other types of code patterns<br />
-- surface level -- code clones copy past code garments<br />
api patterns usage patterns of methods</p>
<p>idiom mining problem --<br />
can i find these templates?</p>
<p>use a probabilistic grammar<br />
CFG slides, pCFG slide</p>
<p>use tree substitution grammar -- generalization of a tree joining grammar<br />
non-terminal can expand into a tree instead of a list of terminals and nonterminals</p>
<p>can make a probabilistic version</p>
<p>tree substitution grammar over tree nodes and regular expansions<br />
represents a family of idioms</p>
<p>this will allows us to represent these idioms</p>
<p>input: probabilistic tree substitution grammar within<br />
take a corpus of ASTs<br />
learn the grammar<br />
every tree rule in the TSG that i learn i treat as an idiom</p>
<p>convert into a textual representation </p>
<p>build a library of idioms to show developers<br />
how do we infer the grammar?</p>
<p>maximum likelihood conditioned on the pTSG rules</p>
<p>previous work from sharon goldwater et al<br />
-- infer what these trees are, pick list of trees that best explain the corpus<br />
-- number of possible things i could put in theta are intractable, maximum likelihood is degenerate, pick 1:1 rules to trees</p>
<p>don&#039;t make tree fragments too big<br />
put a prior on probabilistic grammars<br />
if you&#039;re going to add another tree, this is what the idiom would like<br />
get a joint distribution over pCFGs and source files<br />
dist. over dist. of parse trees</p>
<p>given a corpus code of code to get a distribution over probabilistic grammars over trees i&#039;ve inferred<br />
type-based MCMC from liang et al; (think this is from liang’s GP-like work)</p>
<p>some questions i didn&#039;t catch</p>
<p>mined idioms<br />
iterator, loop through lines, logger for class, string constant<br />
get patterns you would actually find<br />
get something from actual APIs<br />
e.g. database transaction (opening a resource and cleaning up properly)<br />
get the distance between two points in ??<br />
jsoup get mhtl</p>
<p>lots of work in SE in API mining<br />
no syntactically nested things</p>
<p>take a held out set of files<br />
percentage of AST nodes explained by the ---/<br />
existing method for clone detection<br />
completely duplicated ?</p>
<p>copy paste phenomenon</p>
<p>idioms we find occur across projects much more often…?<br />
SE perspective -- dozens of papers in SE about copy past clones</p>
<p>if these things are really idioms, maybe they will occur more often in example code -- actually what happens<br />
from a data set of regular projects on github, we find 22% of idioms found are actually used in examples, higher in stack overflow</p>
<p>finally, can do a co-occurrence matrix -- how are idioms used across different projects<br />
eclipse snipmatch<br />
-- open source addition to eclipse -- manually took 44 snippets, stuff worked or something<br />
cant put all the idioms in the tool, so many found<br />
considered this as validation that the thing works<br />
interesting that there i was one idiom used that is considered bad practice</p>
<p>exploiting that source code is a means of human communication</p>
<p>maybe surprising to people who are from a different background, that you would need to train the model</p>
