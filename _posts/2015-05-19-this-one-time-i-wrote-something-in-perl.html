<p>I was just looking at some old crappy code I wrote four years ago, to show <a href="http://blogs.umass.edu/mmcma0/">Molly</a> that one should have no shame when posting code online. While looking at my own HMM code, I ran across <a href="https://github.com/etosch/HMM/blob/master/scripts/treebank.pl">this code</a>. I have no idea what it does. I just remember wanting to use Perl for string munging crap. Yikes!</p>
