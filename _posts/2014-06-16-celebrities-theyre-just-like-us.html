<p>Hopefully this post will be short and sweet, since I'm trying to get back on EST. </p>
<p>Highlights from this year's PLDI:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Year of PLASMA!</b> <a href="http://people.cs.umass.edu/~jvilk/">John Vilk's</a>  <a href="http://doppiojvm.org/">DoppioJVM</a> won Best Artifact. His talk was great, and he event got a mid-talk round of applause for a meta-circular evaluator joke. Nothing like Scheme to whet the appetites of PL nerds! (I admit it, I clapped and laughed, too.)</li>
<li><b>Year of PLASMA!</b> In a surprising turn of events, my work on <a href="http://surveyman.org">SurveyMan</a> won top prize in the Graduate category of the <a href="http://src.acm.org/">ACM Student Research Competition</a>. This means I'll submit a short paper in a few months to compete in the Grand Finals! Exciting!</li>
<li>The <a href="http://approx2014.cs.umass.edu/">APPROX</a> was awesome! It was very exciting to see current work presented across approximate computing and probabilistic programming. Emery was chair of the event. Given the amount of discussion it engendered, I would say it was a resounding success.</li>
<li>I met a bunch of new people, and connected with those I haven't seen in a while. Shoutouts to <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~asampson/">Adrian Sampson</a> and <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/mcarbin/">Michael Carbin</a>. I'll be following <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~asampson/blog/">Adrian's blog</a> now, and pestering Michael about formalizing the SurveyMan semantics (using his work on <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/rinard/paper/pldi12.relaxed.pdf">reasoning about relaxed programs</a> as a guide).</li>
<li>A cheeky dig at the New York Times lead to <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/">Phil Wadler</a> telling me that I had the best teaser! Famous professors : they're just like us!</li>
<li><a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/">Shriram Krishnamurthi</a> declared he'd read this blog.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other news, I need to try uploading my VM for the OOPSLA artifact evaluation, now that I have reasonable internet again. But first, I need to sleep (though I did set aside time to watch GoT -- OMG, the ending was awesome! Arya's face! That exchange! WTF just happened?!?!? Also, shit's finally starting to get real, north of the wall! You know nothing, Jon Snow...)</p>
