<p>Someday I will post a longer essay on everything that is wrong with this film and how it's hurting America and how everything is going to hell because all the kids internet all day. I watched it two days ago and am still irritated by the characters, the plot, and how everyone should STFU and get a real job and get off my lawn. The only cinematic sequence to more effectively evoke that strange combination of disgust and boredom was the interminable torture of Theon Greyjoy. </p>
<p>On a score from "Changed my life" to "<a href="http://the-toast.net/2013/11/20/yes-you-can-even/">I've lost my ability to can</a>," Cibele was more forgiving than I and rated it a "I can't even." </p>
<p>Also, for those who are wondering, the worst is a tie between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazis_at_the_Center_of_the_Earth">Nazis at the Center of the Earth</a>* and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanted_%282008_film%29">Wanted</a>. </p>

* I may have "fast-forwarded" through chunks of this film, so it isn't clear it's actually eligible for first place.<br />
